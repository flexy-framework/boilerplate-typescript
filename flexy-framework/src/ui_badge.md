## Text

<span class="b-badge">Lorem Ipsum</span> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
<span class="b-badge">Lorem Ipsum</span> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
